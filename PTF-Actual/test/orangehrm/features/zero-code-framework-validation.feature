Feature: Zero-Code Framework Validation - OrangeHRM Live Test
  As a Framework Developer
  I want to validate the zero-code feature works correctly with OrangeHRM
  So that I can confidently publish the framework to ADO

  # ====================================================================================
  # IMPORTANT: This is a TEMPORARY test file for framework validation
  # These tests will be REMOVED after successful validation before ADO commit

    - All steps execute without step definitions
    - NLP correctly identifies intent (navigate, type, click, assert)
    - AI identifies elements correctly (username, password, button, page)
    - Steps pass successfully

  # VALIDATION SUMMARY
  # ====================================================================================
  # After running these tests, verify:
  # ✅ All TC901-TC906 pass (core zero-code functionality)
  # ✅ TC907 fails gracefully with proper error message
  # ✅ TC908 passes (configuration correct)
  # ✅ TC909 completes in <10 seconds
  # ✅ TC910-TC912 all pass when run in parallel (no interference)
  #
  # If all validations pass → Zero-code feature is PRODUCTION READY
  # Then: Remove this file and commit to ADO
